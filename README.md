A simple 3D editor on DirectX12.

This is a course work within the framework of my
studies at the university ([BSUIR](https://www.bsuir.by/en/) "Computer Science and Programming Technologies"). A simple 3D model editor on [DirectX12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirectX) is for your attention. It is capable of import and export three-dimensional models in various formats (such as [.fbx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBX), [.dae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COLLADA), [.obj](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obj), etc.), perform simple edits and also has a built-in preview of the result. The project uses [Win32](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_API#Major_Versions) and [DirectX12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirectX) for visualization on a graphics adapter(GPU), [assimp](https://github.com/assimp/assimp) for loading and unloading models, and [ImGUI](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) for the user interface. Use [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/ru/vs/) to build project.
